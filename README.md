The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a desktop application built using Python, Tkinter, and Matplotlib to streamline hospital operations. It offers an intuitive interface for managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and generating reports without requiring a database. The system also includes basic data visualization to help administrators track key hospital metrics. Further enhancements are in progress, including improved UI/UX, additional features for better patient management, and advanced data visualization for more insightful analytics.
